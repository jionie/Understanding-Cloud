Given the change in score, we can calculate the empty labels for each class as follows:

Sugar

(0.477 – 0.388) * 14,792 = ~1316 empty masks for Sugar

Gravel

(0.477 – 0.361) * 14,792 = ~1716 empty masks for Gravel

Flower

(0.477 – 0.329) * 14,792 = ~2190 empty masks for Flower

Fish

(0.477 – 0.353) * 14,792 = ~1834 empty Masks for Fish


So an empty submission gets us a score of 0.477. We know that each time we made a correct empty prediction we got a perfect Dice Score of 1.0, and we know that each time we made an incorrect empty prediction we got the worst Dice Score of 0.0. This means we can calculate the total number of empty masks.

0.477 * 14,792 = ~7,055 empty masks.

We can go further and calculate the exact number of empty masks for each class.

Let’s take take our empty predictions for a single class and replace them with a bad prediction (eg. a single pixel in the top-left corner). On every single empty mask for this class, our score will drop from 1.0 to 0.0.** We can use this drop to calculate how many empty masks must have been present.
